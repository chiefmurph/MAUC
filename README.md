**Modeling ALAE Using Copulas**

Greg McNulty (FCAS),
a member of the 
[CAS Open Source Software Committee](http://opensourcesoftware.casact.org/),
wrote the paper
[Modeling ALAE Using Copulas](http://opensourcesoftware.casact.org/blogs:2)
on that committee's 
[blog site](http://opensourcesoftware.casact.org/).
With McNulty's generous consent,
the R code included with his paper has been uploaded to this github site.
The idea is to help actuaries
learn about and work with
the ideas actualized through Greg's code.

The first goal: create a 
[shiny app](http://shiny.rstudio.com/)
that runs McNulty's algorithms and reproduces his results.

## To utilize this site

Clone this repository on your local computer.
Perhaps the easiest way to do that is via 
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), 
a third-party interface to R.
However, for 
[git](https://git-scm.com) I predominently
use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
because 

1. it implements an important and powerful workflow,
[branching](https://git-scm.com/about/branching-and-merging), 
one of `git`'s strengths, and
2. its maintainers have been
very responsive to my questions in the past.

If you only use this site as a source for ideas,
no problem,
the code is open source.
In that case be courteous and give credit where credit is due,
and enjoy.
